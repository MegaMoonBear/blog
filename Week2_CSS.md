##CSS block##
<p>
  This week was not for the *faint of heart*. It wasn't tougher than the prior week, but new info on CSS was **integrated** with prior info on HTML. 
  <ul>
    <li> CSS can be added in 3 places or methods - inline, in the head of the HTML file, or in a separate ~.css file </li>
    <li> A separate ~.css file's syntax is implemented in the HTML file with "link" </li>
    <li> Novice-level animations can be accomplished with small and/or short changes that the human brain tends to ignore.</li>
  </ul>
  We also had what seemed like more assignments that might have taken more time. Plus we took a quiz and have a *test* on Monday. I am very grateful that the test wasn't Thu. or Fri. this week.
